Abstract

In the realm of critical infrastructure, the timely dissemination of information regarding software and hardware vulnerabilities is crucial to maintaining operational security. Currently, vulnerability information from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and software vendors is often delayed when published through platforms such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), which can leave critical systems exposed to threats for longer than necessary. The proposed solution aims to tackle this gap by implementing an automated, real-time system that monitors vendor security advisories, scrapes vulnerability information directly from these sources, and disseminates timely alerts to relevant stakeholders. This solution leverages advanced web scraping, cloud-based infrastructure, and Large Language Models (LLMs) to ensure that critical vulnerabilities are promptly communicated to affected organizations, significantly reducing the time between vulnerability disclosure and remediation.

To begin, a database of vendors and their security advisory pages will be established, with entries populated by scraping the NVD and manually supplementing vendor information as needed. This database will continuously grow and update as new vulnerabilities emerge. The monitoring process will involve periodic lookups on the vendor advisories to detect changes indicative of newly disclosed vulnerabilities. A distributed network of AWS Lambda functions will be utilized to carry out this monitoring process efficiently, triggering scraping tasks when new advisories are detected. This architecture ensures scalability and low-latency response times by leveraging AWS Lambda’s event-driven capabilities.

Once new vulnerability information is detected, AWS Lambda will trigger a scraping process to extract the raw content from the advisory pages. This raw content will then be sent to an LLM deployed via AWS SageMaker or AWS Bedrock for processing. SageMaker provides the flexibility to train, fine-tune, and deploy LLMs capable of understanding the structure of security advisories and extracting key information such as product name, version, severity level, vulnerability details, and mitigation strategies. AWS Bedrock, on the other hand, offers ready-made foundation models that simplify integration and reduce the time to deployment. The LLM, accessed through these AWS services, will be responsible for structuring the extracted information into a well-defined format suitable for notification purposes. The deployment of LLMs on scalable AWS infrastructure ensures both high performance and adaptability to varying workloads, which is particularly important as the volume of vulnerability disclosures fluctuates over time.

After processing the advisory information, the LLM will generate a structured, human-readable message that captures all critical aspects of the vulnerability. This message will be formatted according to a predefined template, ensuring consistency in communication. The AWS Simple Email Service (SES) will be used to dispatch these notifications to subscribed users in near real-time. Users will also be able to manage their subscriptions through a web portal, allowing them to choose which vendors they wish to receive alerts from, ensuring relevance and reducing information overload. This overall approach results in faster dissemination of vulnerability alerts compared to waiting for NVD updates, as advisories are scraped directly from vendor pages shortly after publication.

The proposed solution integrates various modern technologies to ensure a comprehensive, robust, and real-time vulnerability monitoring and alerting system. By leveraging AWS cloud infrastructure, web scraping, and LLM-based data processing, this system aims to mitigate the risk posed by unpatched vulnerabilities in critical systems by drastically reducing the delay between vulnerability publication and the receipt of actionable information. This proactive approach enhances the cybersecurity posture of critical sector organizations, ensuring they are alerted to emerging threats in the shortest possible time, empowering them to mitigate risks effectively and protect their infrastructure from potential exploitation.
